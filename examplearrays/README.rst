Example Arrays
==============
Darr arrays consist of a folder with a raw, headerless binary file, one or
two JSON text files (depending on presence of metadata) and a README text file
with documentation and code for reading the array in a variety of languages.

Darr ragged array contain two subfolders representing Darr arrays in addition
to JSON and README text files.

Examples are provided here of both regular and ragged ragged arrays, for
all possible numeric types. Browse the array and ragged array folders
containing these arrays (folders with a '.darr' suffix) to see how easy it is
to get a sense of the data that is represented, and how it can be read.
