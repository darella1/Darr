Examples
========
Examples are provided here of both regular and ragged ragged arrays, for
all possible numeric types. Browse the `array <arrays>`__ and
`ragged array <raggedarrays>`__ folders containing these arrays (which
themselves are the folders with a '.darr' suffix) to see how easy it is to get
a sense of the data that is represented, and how it can be read.
